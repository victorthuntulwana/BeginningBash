# Question

Explain the use of tab completion?

# Answer

Tab completion is a feature that allows you to complete the names of commands, files, and directories by pressing the Tab key. This can save you a lot of time and typing, especially if you are working with long or complex names. To use tab completion, simply start typing the name of the command, file, or directory that you want to complete. Then, press the Tab key. If there is only one match, the shell will complete the name for you. If there are multiple matches, the shell will display a list of possible completions. You can then use the arrow keys to select the completion that you want, and press Enter to accept it.
